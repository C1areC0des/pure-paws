  <div class="about">
    <p>We are both active non-smokers and we care deeply about the welfare of the animals we look after.  We like to ensure that the properties we sit at are secure at all times and are kept to a high standard of cleanliness, both during and after the sit.</p>
    <p>We are able to work remotely and so we love to take advantage of this by sitting in areas that are new, or beloved by us. We find that this works so well for the animals we look after, as we are able to keep them company nearly all the time.</p>
